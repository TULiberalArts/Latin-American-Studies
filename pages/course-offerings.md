**Dear LAS Students, Faculty and Friends**, 
Please check out the updated Spring 2020 LAS course offerings with preapproved credit listings for Spanish Majors and Minors, and Global Studies Majors and Minors.  As you may note from our cross-listed courses with History, Religion, Anthropology, and Africology and African American Studies we are offering a wide-array of classes that focus on Latin America.
We look forward to seeing you in class!
Muchos saludos,
Adam
