Latin American Studies (LAS) offers an interdisciplinary approach to learning about the politics, economics, cultures, and societies of Latin America and the Caribbean. LAS uses this region as a framework for exploring thematic issues in such disciplines as anthropology, art, history, political science, Spanish and Portuguese, and communication studies.

Courses are offered in departments from every school and college, and our affiliated faculty research diverse topics from development economics to immigrant healthcare, from Latin American music to colonial literature. Our students become true experts who can speak to a wide range of issues confronting Latin America: experts who can contribute proactively to development and cooperation, as well as to business and political analysis in a way that their peers with a more traditional disciplinary focus cannot.
