Spanish and Portuguese aren’t restricted to just Latin America, Spain and Portugal—they’re spoken around the world. So why restrict your Portuguese or Spanish education to just the classroom? Start an internship; apply for [awards and scholarships](#awards-and-scholarships); join the [Club de Español](#club-de-español) or the [Graduate Students of Language at Temple](#graduate-students-of-language-at-temple-gsolt).

## Internships
The Department of Spanish and Portuguese maintains relationships with a variety of organizations throughout Philadelphia, offering students ample volunteer, community service, research and internship opportunities. Students gain real-world language and work experience through this experiential learning, increasing their skills and confidence.

Throughout the academic year, students of any level may volunteer with educational and neighborhood organizations, such as mentoring primary and high school students, teaching seniors or contributing to the greening of the city infrastructure. In the summer, advanced students may receive credit by taking an internship course for which they invest significant time in an organization. Students have been engaged in service opportunities in journalism, social services, law, heath care, educational development and immigrant rights. By using their language skills to fulfill their responsibilities, students maximize their classroom learning and attain poise in a professional setting.

## Club de Español
The Spanish Club is a student organization, and its principal goal is to promote the practice of speaking Spanish. One way we achieve this goal is through conversation tables, which allow you to practice your conversation skills in a relaxed environment once a week. We also invite you to join us in celebrating the Hispanic culture all year round with different activities. The Spanish Club meets weekly throughout the semester on Mondays from 4-5 p.m. in 422 Anderson Hall.

Everyone is welcome to join the Spanish Club, and you’re still able to participate in our events even if you don’t become a member. Stop by our meetings and bring friends!
