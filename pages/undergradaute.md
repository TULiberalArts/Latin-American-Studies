College of Liberal Arts students are immersed in Latin American culture and languages in the classroom, but we also encourage them to go travel the world and see Latin America by studying abroad. Temple University students can earn a [bachelors of arts](#ba-in-latin-american-studies) in Latin American Studies degree or [minor](#minor-in-latin-american-studies) in Latin American Studies. Either way, they get a world-class education about one of the world’s most important regions.

## An Immersive Experience
Students of Latin American Studies have the opportunity to participate in the Latin American Studies Semester (LASS) through the Department of Spanish & Portuguese. Students take classes only in the target language and have the opportunity to study abroad together for several weeks in a Latin American country.

## Travel The World
Our students have the opportunity to study in Latin America for a semester or more. Our interdisciplinary program means that most credits taken through approved study abroad programs will apply toward graduation. Recent graduates have studied in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru.

##  BA in Latin American Studies
The Latin American Studies Major is an interdisciplinary program with a focus on the study of social problems of Latin America. Latin America’s art, literature and religious thought have been universally recognized for their high quality and contribution to world civilization. At the same time, extreme social inequality persists in Latin America in addition to rapid urban growth, dramatic ecological change and political upheavals with powerful local and global implications. The Latin American Studies major offers a variety of courses that examine these issues. To complete the major, students must take twelve 3-credit courses in Latin American Studies, and demonstrate a reading and speaking knowledge of Spanish or Portuguese.
