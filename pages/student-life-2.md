## Club de Español
The Spanish Club is a student organization, and its principal goal is to promote the practice of speaking Spanish. One way we achieve this goal is through conversation tables, which allow you to practice your conversation skills in a relaxed environment once a week. We also invite you to join us in celebrating the Hispanic culture all year round with different activities. The Spanish Club meets weekly throughout the semester on Mondays from 4-5 p.m. in 422 Anderson Hall.

Everyone is welcome to join the Spanish Club, and you’re still able to participate in our events even if you don’t become a member. Stop by our meetings and bring friends!
